    :description lang=en: Comprehensive C and C++ programming reference with working code examples. Covers modern C11/C17/C23, C++11/14/17/20/23, POSIX system programming, debugging tools, and build systems.
    :keywords: C, C++, modern C++, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, C11, C17, C23, system programming, POSIX, CMake, GDB, Valgrind, debugging, Linux programming

C and C++ continue to evolve with new standards that bring modern features while maintaining the performance and control that make these languages essential for systems programming. This cheatsheet focuses on collecting useful code snippets and practical examples, covering everything from language fundamentals to advanced topics like coroutines, CUDA programming, and lock-free data structures. Examples are organized by topic with source code available in the repository for building and experimentation.

Whether you're refreshing your memory on pointer arithmetic, exploring modern C++23 features, debugging a tricky memory issue with Valgrind, or figuring out how to set up a CMake project, you'll find practical examples here. The goal is simple: provide clear, working code that you can understand and adapt for your own projects.
