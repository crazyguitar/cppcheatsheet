   :description: Comprehensive guide to modern C++ features from C++11 to C++23, covering smart pointers, lambdas, templates, coroutines, RAII, STL containers, and algorithms.
   :keywords: modern C++, C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, C++23, smart pointers, lambda expressions, templates, coroutines, RAII, STL, move semantics, constexpr

The C++ language has undergone a remarkable transformation since C++11, evolving into a powerful,
expressive language that supports multiple programming paradigms while maintaining backward
compatibility and zero-cost abstractions. Each subsequent standard—C++14, C++17, C++20, and
C++23—has introduced features that simplify code, improve safety, and enable new programming
patterns.

The following chapters explore resource management through RAII and smart pointers, generic
programming with templates and concepts, functional programming with lambda expressions,
compile-time computation with constexpr, asynchronous programming with coroutines, and data
manipulation using STL containers and algorithms.
