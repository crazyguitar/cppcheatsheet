Modern C Programming
====================

   :description: Comprehensive C programming reference covering language fundamentals, preprocessor macros, GNU extensions, Makefile build systems, and x86 assembly integration.

Despite decades of evolution in programming languages, C remains the lingua franca of systems
software, embedded development, and performance-critical applications. Its direct access to
memory and hardware, combined with portability across computing platforms, makes it indispensable
for operating systems, compilers, and firmware development.

Here you will find coverage of language syntax and semantics, preprocessor directives and macro
techniques for code generation, GNU compiler extensions that enhance expressiveness, build
automation with Make for managing complex compilation workflows, and x86 assembly language
fundamentals for low-level optimization and hardware interaction.
