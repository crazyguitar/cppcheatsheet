The command line remains the most powerful interface for automating tasks, managing systems,
and orchestrating complex workflows. Bash, as the default shell on most Linux distributions
and macOS, provides a rich scripting environment that glues together the Unix toolbox into
cohesive solutions.

These references cover shell syntax and control flow, regular expressions for text processing,
the find command for filesystem traversal, date manipulation for logs and scheduling,
hardware monitoring with tools like lspci and nvidia-smi, and systemd for modern service
management. Together, they form the toolkit for effective system administration and
development automation.
